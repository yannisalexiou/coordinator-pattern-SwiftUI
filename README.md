# Coordinator Pattern for SwiftUI (iOS 16+)

This version has been updated to be fully compatible with iOS 16+, leveraging the latest SwiftUI improvements while retaining the simplicity and elegance of the Coordinator pattern.

# Requirements
* iOS 16 or later
* Xcode 16 or later
* Swift 5 or later


# A Special Thanks to the Original Authors
This project is a fork of the amazing GosutoDev/coordinator-pattern-SwiftUI.

Special thanks to [GosutoDev](https://github.com/GosutoDev) for the original implementation, which served as the foundation for this fork, and for sharing such a well-crafted solution with the SwiftUI community.

Additionally, GosutoDev was inspired by [Ales Dieo](https://medium.com/@ales.dieo/swiftui-solid-navigation-the-coordinator-pattern-part-1-a58dc976a13e), whose Medium article is an excellent resource on implementing navigation with pure SwiftUI. Without their contributions, this project wouldn't exist in its current form.
